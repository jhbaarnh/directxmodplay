# slow but audio-freak-quality

# linear destortion 0-20kHz is between +0...-1dB
# S/N and mirror frequency suppression better than 96dB
#
# overall gain is set to 0.8 (-2dB) to be safe on overload distortion
# if you are sure you have more than 2dB headroom on the input signal
# you can modify 0.8 to 1.0 (0dB)
